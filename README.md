## üõ†Ô∏è **Methodology**

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Sales data from January 2020 to April 2024 was cleaned and pre-processed.
   - Missing values were imputed, and data was decomposed to understand seasonal patterns.

2. **Model Selection**:
   - Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models were used for forecasting.
   - Models were selected based on their ability to handle trends and seasonality.

3. **Validation**:
   - Performance was evaluated using metrics like AIC, residual analysis, and forecast accuracy.

## üí° **Recommendations**

1. **Inventory Management**:
   - Optimize inventory levels based on seasonal trends.
   - Avoid overstocking or understocking during high or low demand periods.

2. **Strategic Focus**:
   - Increase marketing and production during high-demand months.
   - Plan promotions during periods of low demand to maintain revenue.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations**

1. **Data Constraints**:
   - Forecasts depend on the quality and completeness of the historical data.
   - Limited dataset length may restrict long-term trend analysis.

2. **External Factors**:
   - Factors such as economic conditions, competition, and policy changes are not included in the models.

3. **Model Assumptions**:
   - SARIMA assumes stationarity after differencing, which may not account for all structural breaks.
